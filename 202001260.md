# Lab 5 - Static Analysis

# Static Analysis
Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability, performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the development process.

# Static Analysis Tools
Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the
version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.

* The tool used in this lab: **Pylint**
